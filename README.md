# Role-of-intrinsically-disordered-regions-on-the-catalytic-efficiency-of-enzymes
The IPYNB file contains a pipeline of codes to extract the enzyme and IDR data from their respective databases and perform a series of operations to map the IDR like regions on enzyme sequences and their effect on enzymatic catalysis. 
The codes can either be used as a pipeline to carry out the sane study or sections can be independently used to by users to analyse their own datasets. 
Some of the starter files are provided for the users to use for their analysis.
